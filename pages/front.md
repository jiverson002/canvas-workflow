# Canvas Workflow

Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you
need to be able to package up your theme into a gem. Put your layouts in
`_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your sass files in `_sass` and any
other assets in `assets`.

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec
jekyll serve` – this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

```
.
├── .travis.yml
├── README.md
├── _config.yml
├── ...
└── files
    └── ...
```

Create a file called `_config.yml` with the following contents:

{% gist jiverson002/8d1737a9faa1b223883eb80ff8ac0464 %}

replacing anything in <...> with your own information, and create a file called
`.travis.yml` with the following contents:  

{% gist jiverson002/d2b79ceb173c1cf2d94714dd68e7bbc1 %}

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here. Describe your available layouts, includes,
sass and/or assets.
